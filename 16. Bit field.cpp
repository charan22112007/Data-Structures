/*Bit field
	--> Bit field is used to specify the number of bits allocated to the structured member,
	--> It is mainly ised to save memory,
	--> Bit fields are only alloowed in structures inly,
	--> Bitfield doesn't support for arrays and pointers,
	--> Each bitfield member must be in INTEGER format and it doesn't support float and double,
	Syntax:
		struct structure_name
		{
		datatype member_name : number_of_bits;
		};
	--> Number of bits defines, how many bits the member should occupy.
